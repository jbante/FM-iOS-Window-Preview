# FM-iOS Window Preview

Version 2

iOS Window Preview resizes the current window so the content area matches what would be available on an iPhone or iPad. This helps developers design layouts for iOS devices without constantly switching back-and-forth between a test device and a desktop development machine.

## Installation

Import the "iOS Window Preview" script folder to your file's "Modules" folder.
